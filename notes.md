## Content to add to ghpages ##

- digital editing and the Ptolemy Machine:  rationale


## Content to add to master branch ##

- √ compute coordinate values using greeklang lib
- √ shrink coords by 250/180 ratio
- √ compute offset of latitude from Rhodes
- use a data set of equivalents to find offset of longitude from 0


## Analyses to develop as ORCA Collections ##

Contained in the text citation hierarchy:

- √ continents
- √ provinces

Cutting across the citation hierarchy:

- geographic type
- physical geographic region or feature
- ethnic/cultural group


## Verification of the edition ##

- check spatial consistency of provinces



## Analysis ##

- assemble data by all 7 Ptolemaic properties
- constructed ordered coasts
- identify degree of precision for points selected by Ptolemaic property
- compute density for points selected by Ptolemaic property

## Develop secondary data sets ##

- composite geo objects (especially rivers) 

## Visualization ##


- implementations of both global projections
- regional maps?


## Coordination with MSS? ##

How best coordinate machine data with MSS?


## Alignment with external data sets ##

- Pelagios. How can we best associate this project's identifiers with Pelagios identifiers?
- Recent Bern edition and associated database.  As each section of the text is validated, each geographic entity could be checked for alignment with the Bern database; conversely, each Bern entry in the corresponding section of the text can be checked against this project's inventory.  Discrepancies could be due to (at least) the following possibilities:
    - discrepancy is due to an error in one of the tables:  for Bern, I can check the table entry against the printed text;  for my edition, I need to go back to see if the digital edition reflects the digitized print source.  For books 2-3, that's Müller:  for books 4-7 it's Nobbe, so I want to handle them separately.
    - discrepancy in the tables accurately reflects a difference in the editions
